properties:
  timestamp:
    description: Timestamp of the observation.
    type: string
  averageTopThirdWaveHeight:
    description: Significant wave height, the average value of the highest one-third of wave heights observed over a 30-minute period.
    type: number
  maxHeight:
    description: Height of the largest wave observed over a 30-minute period.
    type: number
  averageTopThirdWavePeriod:
    description: |
      Significant period, defined by the average value of the periods of the highest one-third of the largest waves observed
      over a 30-minute period.
    type: number
  peakDirection:
    description: |
      Average direction of wave origin at the peak of the energy spectrum. The angle is measured positively, in a clockwise
      direction, between geographic north and the direction of the wave origin.
    type: number
  peakDirectionalSpread:
    description: |
      Directional width, characterizing the directional spread of energy around the average direction at the peak (angular
      distribution function of energy associated with the peak frequency of the energy spectrum).
    type: integer
  temperature:
    description: Water temperature in degrees Celsius at the time of the observation.
    type: number
